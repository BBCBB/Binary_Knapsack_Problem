# Binary_Knapsack_Branch_and_Bound
There are different approaches to deal with the knapsack problem. Here, I used the branch and bound method to solve the problem.
The main steps to solve this problem are:
Linear relaxation of the problem: we should relax the constraint of the decision variable being discrete. in other words, we will have 0=<x<=1 instead of x in {0,1}.

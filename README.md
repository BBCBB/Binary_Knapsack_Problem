# Binary_Knapsack_Branch_and_Bound
There are different approaches to deal with the knapsack problem. 
If you used the branch and bound method to solve the problem, the main steps would be:
Linear relaxation of the problem: we should relax the constraint of the decision variable being discrete. in other words, we will have 0=<x<=1 instead of x in {0,1}.

Moreover, you are provided with dynamic programming approach, which outperforms the branch and bound when the size of the problem grows in terms of solving time.
